RECIPES is a simple project which uses TheMealDB API to fetch recipe information like ingredients, instructions, and images when you search for a dish. Itâ€™s built with ReactJS, which helps create interactive and fast web pages by updating only the parts of the page that change. When you click on a recipe, the app shows detailed instructions and links to YouTube tutorials. React makes it easy to update the page in real time without reloading.
